# Households in Oregon

## Description

The file OR_house.csv contains household-level responses to the American Community Survey for households in Oregon. Technically this is a Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) from the 2015 1-year survey. The data came from http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2015/1-Year/. 

A subset of variables is given, and only households that have one person or more are paying for their electricity. You may assume this is a random sample of all such households in Oregon. The variable descriptions can be found in PUMS_Data_Dictionary_2011_2015.txt.

The question of interest to analyze this data is to know if the electricity cost in Oregon in 2015, is less expensive for people living in apartments than people living in houses.
